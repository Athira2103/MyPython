# Data Science and Machine Learning 

Welcome to the world of data analytics with Python! This is a repository that I have created to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Science and Machine learning related topics from the Data Science and Machine Learning course I have completed. I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

Python is a popular programming language and software environment for data analysis. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and researchers because of its powerful tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modelling.
